Remember when iPhones came out with the slogan "There is an app for everything"?. Well, there is also a _browser extension_ for everything.

## Distances and colors

For this challenge you will need to measure distances on screen, and colors. This is an extension that does both:

- For Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pixelzoomer/
- For Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixelzoomer/fogkjckfkdcnmnnfmbieljpkmmihhpao

Alternatively, you can install separate extensions for measuring distances and picking colors (you can find _a lot_ of them on the respective stores).

Or yet another alternative: you can open the image with an image editing application such as Photoshop, Affinity Photo, or an online alternative such as https://www.photopea.com/.

## Fonts

You can try to find a similar font to use by looking at https://fonts.google.com/, or by using the Font Indentifier tool by Font Squirrel (https://www.fontsquirrel.com/matcherator). This is optional and not required.

## Pixel Perfect

A trick to help you achieve "pixel-perfect-ness" is to set the mockup image as background, and build your interface on top of it. For an example of the technique you can see: https://codepen.io/mjsarfatti/pen/bGEajJY
