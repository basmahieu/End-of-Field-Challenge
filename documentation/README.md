# End of Field Challenge

- Repository name: `end-of-field-challenge`
- Mode: `solo`
- Type of Challenge: `consolidation`
- Duration: `1 day`
- Deployment strategy: GitHub Pages or Netlify site

## Before you start

First, [read the criteria](./Criteria.md) so that you know what is expected of you.

Second, read about [some tips and tools](./Tips-and-tools.md) that might be helpful.

You got it? Ok, now follow the instructions. Think "pixel-perfect".

## The challenge

In this exercise you will build two full integrations.  
As often is with CSS, this is an exercise in precision and accuracy (and a zest of dementia, because... CSS).

For each interface :

- Create a standard html page based on this template (replace `[filename]` with the filename of the mockup image you are building):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Interface [filename]</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Your code here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

- Create a standard `style.css` stylesheet and link it to the html page
- Add the relevant HTML and CSS code so that the end result looks as similar as possible to the provided _mockup images_.

### Rules

1. This is a `solo` challenge. And since this is also a test, you are **not allowed to ask for help** from your fellow juniors this time ãƒ„
2. You are allowed, of course, to use documentation sites, Google, stackoverflow.com and any other resource that you would normally use. Internet is your friend.
3. You _MAY_ use SASS if it makes the job easier, but it will not give you extra points.
4. You _MAT NOT_ use a CSS framework, _nor_ copy CSS code from a framework.
5. Commit (and push) at least once every hour (set a timer to remind you if you need to).
6. If there is anything that you don't understand about this exercise, ask your coach on your promotion's Discord channel!

## Interfaces

Find out which interfaces randomness has assigned to you on [this file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VHsplLnSCTOBXDkGLceplN_QB59hcb8EGtuGld9RZqk/edit#gid=414056782).

Each one of you has been assigned two _simple_ interfaces, and a more _complex_ one. You may choose to build the two simple ones, or one simple AND the complex one.

You will find the images in the folders `images/normal-res/simple` and `images/normal-res/complex`. Those are the images you have to refer to for dimensions, distances, fonts and colors. You will notice there is a second version of each image in the folders `images/hi-res/simple` and `images/hi-res/complex`. You may use these images if you need to look into smaller details, but beware that the dimensions may be wrong.

**Remember:** Choosing one simple and the complex interface will allow you to get a CSS and HTML badge _level 2_, but **only if** they are both executed in time and are pixel-perfect. Don't worry if you don't get a level 2 now: you still have time until the end of the training!

## Done?

Are you sure? [Review the criteria](./Criteria.md) before sending your work to the coaches.

## Really done?

Bravo! These interfaces are not easy ones! Give yourself a big pat on the back, because your CSS muscles seem to be working great! (It's okay if they feel sour...)
